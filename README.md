# Unemployment Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes unemployment trends and rates, particularly the rise in unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate is calculated as the percentage of unemployed individuals in the total labor force. This analysis provides insights into labor market dynamics and economic challenges.

## Key Features
- Explores unemployment trends across different demographics and timeframes.
- Visualizes the impact of external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on employment rates.
- Provides actionable insights for economic analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file to perform the analysis.

## Outputs
- Interactive graphs showcasing trends and patterns in unemployment rates.
- Summary statistics highlighting key findings.

### 3. **Iris Flower Classification**

```markdown
# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project classifies iris flowers into their species: **setosa**, **versicolor**, and **virginica**, based on their features. It demonstrates the application of classification algorithms in identifying patterns within a dataset.

## Key Features
- Preprocesses and cleans the Iris dataset.
- Visualizes data patterns to uncover relationships among features.
- Builds a model to classify iris species with high accuracy (93%).

## Technologies Used
- Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Classification: Scikit-learn

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file to train the model and classify flower species.

## Outputs
- Visualization of the Iris dataset.
- A classification report showing model performance.
